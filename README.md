# testTimeTracker
 
The task is a part of the platform development for Employee attendance system with Clock in/Clock out options.

✅To illuminate request to backend, you have to send requests (this is tested with DevTools and 404 requests are still OK )

✅But as there is no existing backend for this particular task, you can return dump data from the services that actually makes request

✅There is no given design layout / wireframe for the task, as we want to test your creativity as well.

Requirements for Front End
### 1. clock-in/clock-out page - api/user/check
### 2. login for admin page -> api/admin/login
### 3. sign up for admin -> api/admin/signup
### 4. admin dashboard result -> api/admin/employees/overview
### 5. use temp value since you do not have back end side of the application.
